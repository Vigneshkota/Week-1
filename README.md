## Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System using ML

### **Description**  
This project utilizes **machine learning** to recommend suitable **crops** and **fertilizers** based on **soil properties**, **weather conditions**, and crop requirements. The system helps improve agricultural productivity while ensuring **sustainable farming practices**.

### **Steps and Methodology**  
1. **Importing Libraries**:  
   - Essential libraries like `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, and `Seaborn` are used for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

2. **Dataset Handling**:  
   - The dataset is **loaded**, and operations such as viewing the data (`head()`, `tail()`), checking for **null values** (`isnull()`), duplicates (`duplicated()`), and statistical overview (`describe()`) are performed to understand data quality and distribution.

3. **Analysis**:  
   - Insights are derived from the dataset, including **column-specific value counts** and relationships, to guide model development.

### **Final Outcome**  
The system predicts:  
- The **most suitable crop** for a given set of **soil** and **environmental conditions**.  
- **Optimal fertilizer combinations** and quantities to enhance yield and reduce waste.

This approach ensures **efficiency in farming** and minimizes **environmental impact** through data-driven decision-making.
